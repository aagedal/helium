# Developer utilities for ungoogled-chromium

This is a collection of scripts written for developing on ungoogled-chromium. See the descriptions at the top of each script for more information.

## Experimental four-pane split view

`helium/ui/multi-pane-split-view.patch` is applied last in `patches/series`.
It extends the existing split collection to three or four tabs. Select three or
four ordinary tabs with Command-click (macOS) or Control-click, right-click a
selected tab, and use the existing split command. Choose either orientation
when that submenu is available. Four tabs form a 2×2 grid; three tabs form two
small panes beside one larger pane. Changing orientation changes the order in
which the grid is partitioned.

This is an **uncompiled prototype**, not a tested browser release. The patch
was checked against the Chromium version in `chromium_version.txt`, with the
existing Helium patches applied to the affected files. It does not implement
arbitrary recursive splits or an unlimited pane count.

The main divider remains resizable. The subdivisions inside each half are
equal and fixed. Exit split preserves the active tab. Closing or detaching one
pane exits the entire split, following the existing model behavior. Pair-only
reverse, close-half, and replace/swap commands are disabled for grids.
Last-session restore accepts up to four panes; recently closed windows and
Groups restore their tabs without reconstructing a grid. Grid corner styling
and animation clipping use the fallback behavior rather than the pair-specific
window corner/animation rules.

### Checks available in this repository

```sh
python3 devutils/lint.py
python3 devutils/test_multi_pane_split.py
```

The second command compiles the actual grid partition helper extracted from the
patch with C++20 and address/undefined-behavior sanitizers. It checks coverage,
non-overlap, containment, unused panes, pair compatibility, invalid pane counts,
and odd/zero/tiny dimensions across 1,344 cases. It does not compile the browser
or prove that tab activation and session integration work.

To test the complete production header in an already patched source tree:

```sh
python3 devutils/test_multi_pane_split.py --source-tree /path/to/build/src
```

### Browser validation still required

Use the [Helium macOS development build workflow](https://github.com/imputnet/helium-macos/blob/main/docs/building.md#development-build-and-environment).
The packaging repository supplies `dev.sh`, Chromium downloads and the build
toolchain; this core repository alone does not build a browser. Its
`helium-chromium` submodule must contain this private fork's changes and match
the packaging version. After installing that workflow's dependencies, use
`source dev.sh`, `he setup`, `he build`, and `he run`. Use the development
profile provided by `he run` when testing.

The patch adds these tests to Chromium's existing `TabStripModelTest` suite:

- `FourPaneSplitSelectionAndFocus`
- `MoveWithinFourPaneSplit`
- `RestoreFourPaneSplit`

Run those tests and the existing split model tests in a Chromium build. Before
shipping, also check two/three/four panes in both orientations; click and
keyboard activation in every pane; the toolbar's URL; switching between grids,
pairs and ordinary tabs; resizing; devtools and modal dialogs in each pane;
exit/close/detach; pinned/grouped tabs; vertical/horizontal tab strips;
fullscreen; right-to-left layout; and restart/recently-closed restore.
All contributions and any future PR must stay within the private fork.
